Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America. and is the anchor of an urban agglomeration, known as the Golden Horseshoe in Southern Ontario, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is vast population and big geographical area, there also exists big competition between businesses. Therefore it became very challenging for stake holder or new business to decide which area they should start their business to get higher revenue with lowest possible competition.\n"

    "The objective of this report is to determine the best possible location to open a Restaurant in Toronto, based on the different localities of the city, already established restaurants in varios geographical location and ease of accessibility by maximum number of people so that the revenue from the latest venture can be maximized.\n",

    "Therefore I focus on that borough during my analysis. We define potential neighborhood based on the number of restaurant which are operating right in each neighborhood. Toronto has full potential but also is a very challenging district to open a business because of high competition. New restaurant should be open in an area that inadequate neighborhood in this way the restaurant can attract more customers. Therefore, this analysis necessary to ensure that we have enough customers and that we are not so close to other restaurants places."
